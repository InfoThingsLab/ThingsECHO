@par Application Description

The sample application implements an Alexa client for 32F769IDISCOVERY board linked through ethernet to Amazon cloud.

Please refer to STAVS user manual (available on st.com) to get more detailed information.


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - MCU board: 32F769IDISCOVERY (with STM32F769 rev Z)
  
  - Ethernet connection must access to Internet without any proxy
      * The connection to Amazon cloud require an authentication phase. 
      * To proceed, connect a web browser on the same sub-network as the STM32 board.
      * Typically, both connect to a router

  - Authentication: 
      * connect your PC's or smartphone's browser to http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of the board.
      * This address is written on the screen after initialization.
      * When redirected to Amazon server, enter your Amazon credentials
      * then, the browser will try to reach an URL starting with http://stavs?code=... 
      * replace "stavs" by the IP address (and keep the rest of the line unchanged)
      * The board will get a token , and store some info in flash so authentication procedure will not be needed after next reboot.


@par How to use it ?

  - When the initialization is done, and assuming that authentication has been done at least once...

      * The screens displays "Idle" when ready for interaction. 
      * If authentication has not been once (see previous chapter), it displays "restart"

      * Push the blue button for half a second
      * The board outputs a sound (a headset or external speaker must have been plugged to the green connector)
      * Ask your question / request to Alexa

  - The application supports interactions with Alexa with questions like:
      * “Tell me a joke”, “When was Harry Potter published?”
      * "Set an alarm for 7:00 AM!", “Cancel alarm”, ”Set an alarm”
      * "Volume up", "Set volume to 3"

  - To get more information, please refer to the user manual UM2354, available on st.com.
      * UM2354: Alexa Voice Service software expansion for STM32Cube




Application build and flash

  - The application expect the flash to be configured in dual bank (NDBANK = 0). 
      * Run the ST-LINK tool
      * Connect to the board using the Target menu
      * Display the Option Bytes window using the Target menu
      * Un-check nDBANK and apply the change if needed

  - The application embeds an endurance test suite. 
      * These tests need some data that are stored in the Flash. 
      * In most build configurations, the data are stored in the external QSPI flash.
      * A specific build is required to generate the binary containing the assets in QSPI 
            .EWARM and SW2STM32 : 
                .unset the AVS_USE_QSPI_FLASHED flag 
            .MDK-ARM : 
                .unset the AVS_USE_QSPI_FLASHED flag
                .set the  AVS_CREATE_QSPI_SECTION  flag in assetConfig.h (this flag is used in .sct file for section definition)
      * In such a case, the debugger does not program it and the executable file 
      * needs to be programmed through ST-LINK by means of the following sequence of operations:
      * 1.Erase chip command in the Target menu
      * 2. Open File command in the File menu
      * 3. Program & Verify command in the Target menu
      * Note:If the test assets have not been programmed, the ‘Test start’ button does not work.

  - A pre-built binary is located in the folder: Projects/STM32F769I-Discovery/Application/STAVS/Binaries


  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
    installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
    after building.

  - Open and build the project with one of the supported development toolchains (see the release note
    for detailed information about the version requirements).
